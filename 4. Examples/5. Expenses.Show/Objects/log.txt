OPTMIZATION TIPS
----------------------
You are using A LOT of seperate CSS and JS files! This demands a lot of server roundtrips which can slow down your website/webapp considerably
This results in fewer page views, a decreased customer satisfaction and ultimately a loss in sales conversions
 

The total size of your local CSS and JS files is 9.1MB and another 0.7MB in other assets.
It is very important to only load the JS and CSS files from components that you actually use in your website/webapp!
 

If you are using public frameworks (like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc...), consider using their CDN so the browser can use already buffered versions.
Done!
