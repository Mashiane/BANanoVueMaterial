# BANanoVueMaterial

BANanoVueMaterial is the first VueJs based UX framework developed for the BANano transpiler. [VueMaterial link](https://vuematerial.io/) is a Material based framework for VueJS.

With BANano, one is able to code using VB like syntax using B4J from Anywhere Software and the result is a PWA (Progressive Web App) in SPA (Single Page Application) format.

- You code using B4J (Basic4Java)
